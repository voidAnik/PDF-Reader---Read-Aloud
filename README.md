# PDF-Reader---Read-Aloud

# Here only the .apk file will be released. Source code is not been published for privacy for now.

It can list all the pdf files in your device. Then, by selecting you can read then slide them and most importantly this application will read for you with voice reading.
But for now it can read only the typed pdf not the scannned one. I'm working on it to voice read the handwritten/scanned one. For that I'm using ML kit.

After that, I wish to published it to Play Store.
